Interface:

REQUIRES PATCH - exclude conky from opactiy rule: not currently possible, will need to make a pull request
N/A - toggle opacity rule or blur background of opaque window
REQUIRES PATCH - wallpaper fade in: couple of ideas on this one. 1. use hsetroot to somehow generate a fading background or 2. use xscreensaver to put up a black screen and then fade out when everything is loaded. 3 have a look at transset 4 pull request in compton
DONE... - openbox quiet grey background (done, edit /usr/lib/openbox/openbox-autostart and comment out everything except the parts relevant to local config)
- the logout GUI on the openbox wiki
- window snapping


System: 

- compositing: figure out a way to have transparent inactive windows, but transparent openbox menu
- turn off keybinding for shutdown i.e. ctrl+Esc / fn+Esc
- widget for wireless connect
- widget for expressvpn (might have to write that myself)
DONE... - fix nvidia video thing: if hdmi plugged in on boot, screen opens in extended mode instead of duplicate mode. 
- hotplug nvidia and HDMI
- CONSIDER USING THE DISPLAY PORT INSTEAD OF THE HDMI


rEFInd:

- fix logos for other entries (turn on hints when you restart after upgrading system)
- graphical login tool for encrypted LVM partition (sd-encrypt) try plymouth
- install efi binary tools to the EFI partition: shell, gdisk, memtest, fwupdate, firmware
